## IoT Access Control Project with Energy Metering

### Overview
This project is built using an **ESP32** and an **ATmega328P** (with Arduino Bootloader) and interfaces with the following components:  
- **RTC Module**  
- **SD Card**  
- **Current Transformers**  
- **Differential analogue measurement circuit for AC**  
- **other circuits including a voltage divider from 5v to 3.3v,...**
- **Solid State Relays (SSR)**  

### Key Notes
- The code provided is incomplete and requires additional components to make the full system functional.  It contains the **code for the esp32 only**.
- A **circuit board (PCB)** or a **breadboard** is required to assemble the hardware components necessary to run the system.  
- For full functionality, the system must:  
  - Be connected to the **electrical system**.  
  - Interface with the **elevator** to perform measurements and control its operation.  

### Future Updates
More details, including circuit designs, setup instructions, and additional functionality, will be added soon.
